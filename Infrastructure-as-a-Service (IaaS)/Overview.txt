Why Evolve?
Existing infrastructure is not designed to cope with growing demand
There is too much data
Businesses produce vast amounts of unstructured data
Scaling up no longer works
Scaling out is a necessity
Too many service requests
More client devices are coming online—laptops, tablets, phones, watches…
Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) generation is here
Applications and infrastructure were not designed for this level of demand
Traditional capabilities are being exhausted

OpensStack

Modular architecture
Designed to scale out easily
Based on continually growing set of core services

Meets the Demands of Scale-Out Digital Business
Brings public cloud-like capabilities into your datacenter
Provides massive on-demand scale-out capacity
1,000s ? 10,000s ? 100,000s of VMs
Removes vendor lock-in
Open source provides high degree of flexibility to customize and interoperate
Community development = higher “feature velocity”
Features and functions you need, faster to market than proprietary software
Greater automation, resource provisioning, and scaling

Am I Ready for OpenStack?
Traditional: Scale Up (RHEV)
Cloud: Scale Out (OpenStack)
Mixed/Hybrid
Large stateful VM
Small stateless VMs
Combination of traditional scale-up and cloud scale-out workloads
Example: Database may be hosted on traditional workloads, and web front-end and logic layers on cloud workloads
1 application ? 1 VM
1 application ? Many VMs
Life cycle in years
Life cycle hours to months
Increased user demand = Scale up (VM gets bigger)
Increased user demand = Scale out (add VMs)
Not designed to tolerate VM; need features that keep VMs up
If VM dies, application kills it and creates new one; app stays up
Application SLA requires enterprise virtualization features (migration, HA, etc.) to keep applications available


Needs to access hardware resources
Needs an operating environment, hypervisor, services
Leverages existing code libraries for functionality


Depends on the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Optimized and co-engineered with Red Hat Enterprise Linux

A typical OpenStack cloud is made up of at least 9 core services plus plug-ins to interact with third-party systems
These services run on top of a Linux distribution with a complex set of user-space integration dependencies
OpenStack cannot be productized as a standalone layer
A supported, stable platform requires integration and testing of each component

Virtualization: Guest performance, reliability, and Windows
Security: SELinux enforcing guest isolation
Network: Optimized performance for software-defined networking (SDN) and Open vSwitch (OVS)
Storage: Vendor plug-ins, performance, thin provisioning
Ecosystem: Certification of hardware, storage, and networks

Why Red Hat OpenStack Platform
Enterprise-hardened, production-ready code
Co-engineered and integrated with Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Integrated deployment, orchestration, and management tools (director)
Included operational, life cycle, and analytics tool (Red Hat CloudForms)
Foundation for private or public cloud, as well as network functions virtualization (NFV)
World’s largest OpenStack partner ecosystem

Red Hat’s 20-year history in open source gives it the experience and resources to:
Support production-ready customers globally
Drive new features
Influence project strategy and direction
Enable partner collaboration
Wide-ranging participation in OpenStack projects contrasts with most vendors, who are more narrowly focused
These efforts allow Red Hat to create a production-ready distribution with the ecosystem, enterprise life cycle, and support that customers expect from Red Hat
