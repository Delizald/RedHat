ISO and package downloads are accessed via a link at the top of each top-level portal page.
Red Hat Network continues to allow customers to manage software they deploy to servers with Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions.

ABRT
Automatic Bug-Reporting Tool (ABRT) is a daemon that monitors when applications crash.
Collects and stores information about the application, such as:
Command-line arguments
Other information about the application
Memory core dump, if present.
Configure ABRT to do either of the following:
Automatically send information to a relevant issue tracker
Store information locally for review and manually report (default behavior)
ABRT is installed and configured to run at boot-time by default.
If not installed, install abrt package and start abrtd service.
Use chkconfig abrtd on to configure ABRT to start persistently.
Plugins are available to extend ABRT, such as:
abrt-plugin-reportuploader - configure to send crash information to a single server for centralized reporting.
ABRT’s global configuration file is /etc/abrt/abrt.conf.
Plugin configurations are in /etc/abrt/plugins/\*.conf.
Do not store password information in global configuration files; they are world readable.
Override global configurations with individual user configurations defined in ~/.abrt/*.conf.

abrt-cli
abrt-cli can view, report, and delete stored crash information.
Most commonly used abrt-cli parameters:
abrt-cli --list
Lists basic information about each recorded crash.
abrt-cli --report UUID
Reports the crash information specified by the UUID.
abrt-cli --delete UUID
Deletes the crash information specified by the UUID.
ABRT avoids capturing redundant information from repeated crashes by the same application.
Compares a current application crash with stored information.
Until fixed, do not delete crash information with abrt-cli --delete for an application that crashes repeatedly.

sosreport
sosreport collects system data to help Red Hat Global Support Services and Development solve customer problems.
sosreport gathers as much information as possible, while avoiding:
Creation of a very large file
Invasion of user privacy
Collection of information that could be detrimental to system integrity
Working With sosreport
Install the sos RPM appropriate to your version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
[root@server1 ~]# yum -y install sos
... output omitted ...
Run sosreport as root from the command line:
[root@server1 ~]# sosreport

sosreport (version 2.2)

This utility will collect some detailed information about the
hardware and setup of your Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.
... output omitted ...
When finished, you will see:
Please enter your first initial and last name [hostname]:
Please enter the case number that you are generating this report for:
sosreport saves a compressed tar file in /tmp.
[root@server1 ~]# ls /tmp/*tar*
sosreport-serverX-20110829065429-4703.tar.xz
View the contents of the file:
[root@server1 ~]# tar tJf /tmp/sosreport-serverX-20110829065429-4703.tar.xz
... output omitted ...
For more info, see sosreport(1) man page.

netconsole
netconsole sends system console messages to a remote log server when a kernel panic occurs.
Includes register and kernel stack information that helps developers determine what caused the crash.
Make sure you have a network logging server configured.
On the system that crashes, edit /etc/sysconfig/netconsole:
Uncomment the SYSLOGADDR line
Define it as the hostname or IP address of the system acting as a syslog server:
# The IP address of the remote syslog server to send messages to
# SYSLOGADDR=
# The IP address of the remote syslog server to send messages to

SYSLOGADDR=192.168.0. X
Save your changes to the configuration file.
Start netconsole and configure it to restart persistently.
[root@server1 ~]# systemctl enable netconsole
[root@server1 ~]# systemctl start netconsole
This loads a kernel module that sends a syslog message to the host specified by SYSLOGADDR if the system crashes.

kdump
If kernel panic log messages do not provide enough information to diagnose a malfunctioning system, developers may ask for a dump of the system’s memory.
Customers upload dumps to an FTP server.
Red Hat’s support engineers download and analyze them.
Collect dump via a capture kernel:
A small intermediate kernel that recovers system memory and dumps to a file if a crash happens.
Booting the capture kernel does not involve BIOS.
kdump is used from the capture kernel context to either:
Copy hardware memory areas to disk.
Send over a network to another server via SSH.
This is not enabled by default
Can configure at install time.

Manually Enable kdump
Do one of the following:
Run system-config-kdump
Modify /etc/kdump.conf and enable the kdump service:
[root@server1 ~]# less /etc/kdump.conf
[root@server1 ~]# system-config-kdump
Test the “fast boot” mechanism provided by kexec by executing:
[root@server1 ~]# kver=$(uname -r)
[root@server1 ~]# kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-$kver --initrd=/boot/initramfs-$kver.img --command-line="$(cat /proc/cmdline)"
[root@server1 ~]# init 6
Watch the end of the system shutdown carefully; this reboots the kernel but skips the BIOS step.
